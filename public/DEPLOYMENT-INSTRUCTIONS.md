   ```javascript
   window.RAILWAY_API_URL = 'https://your-live-api-url.com';
   ```

3. **Test these endpoints work:**
   - `https://your-api.com/api/nfl/teams` ✅ 32 teams
   - `https://your-api.com/api/nfl/search/players?q=Geno` ✅ Raiders QB
   - `https://your-api.com/health` ✅ Status check

4. **Push the config update:**
   ```bash
   git add public/railway-config.js
   git commit -m "Update API URL with live deployment"
   git push
   ```
