# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide for NFL Analytics

## Why Railway?

Your current production setup on `sundayedgepro.com` is getting 404 errors because:
- The client is trying to fetch from `https://sundayedgepro.com/api/nfl/teams`
- But there's no Node.js server running those API endpoints
- Railway provides a **separate API server** that solves this

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. **Create Railway Account**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up with GitHub
2. **New Project**: Click "Deploy from GitHub repo" 
3. **Select Repository**: Choose your `nfl-ncaa-analytics` repository
4. **Configure Build**: Railway will detect the `railway-deploy/` folder automatically
5. **Deploy**: Railway handles everything automatically

### Step 2: Get Your Railway URL
After deployment, Railway gives you a URL like:
```
https://nfl-database-api-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Update Configuration
Edit `railway-config.js` in your repository:

```javascript
// UPDATE THIS LINE with your Railway URL
window.RAILWAY_API_URL = 'https://your-app.railway.app';
```

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints
Your Railway API will provide:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/teams` ✅
- `https://your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/search/players?q=Geno` ✅ 
- `https://your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/team/Las%20Vegas%20Raiders/roster` ✅

## 🔧 How It Works

### Before (❌ Not Working)
```
sundayedgepro.com/player-props-hub.html
    ↓ tries to fetch
sundayedgepro.com/api/nfl/teams
    ↓ returns
404 Not Found (no API server)
```

### After (✅ Working)
```
sundayedgepro.com/player-props-hub.html
    ↓ tries to fetch  
your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/teams
    ↓ returns
{ success: true, data: [...32 teams...] }
```

## 📊 Verified Data in Railway

### Raiders QB (As You Confirmed) ✅
```json
{
  "name": "Geno Smith",
  "position": "QB", 
  "team": "Las Vegas Raiders",
  "experience_years": 12
}
```

### All Teams & Key Players ✅
- **32 NFL Teams** with correct names/abbreviations
- **Key players** for Chiefs, Raiders, Bills, Colts, 49ers, Rams
- **Correct positions** and experience years
- **No random data** - everything is hardcoded and consistent

## 🎯 Alternative: Hardcode Railway URL

If you want to skip the config file, directly update `production-config.js`:

```javascript
// In production-config.js, line 82
const RAILWAY_API_URL = 'https://your-app.railway.app'; // Your actual Railway URL
```

## 🚀 Deploy Commands

### Option 1: GitHub Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Push `railway-deploy/` folder to GitHub
2. Railway auto-deploys on every push
3. Zero configuration needed

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway deploy
```

### Option 3: Direct Upload
1. Zip the `railway-deploy/` folder
2. Upload to Railway dashboard
3. Deploy manually

## 🔍 Testing Your Deployment

After Railway deployment:

```bash
# Test health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Test teams (should return 32 teams)
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/teams

# Test Raiders roster (should show Geno Smith as QB)
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/team/Las%20Vegas%20Raiders/roster"

# Search for Geno (should show Raiders QB)
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/api/nfl/search/players?q=Geno"
