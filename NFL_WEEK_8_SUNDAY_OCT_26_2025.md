## 🚨 INJURY IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Key Injuries Affecting Today's Games:

#### 🏥 CRITICAL INJURIES TO MONITOR:

**Quarterbacks:**
- Monitor all QB injury reports pre-game
- Backup QB situations drastically change betting lines
- Check warmup reports 90 minutes before kickoff

**Running Backs:**
- RB injuries increase value for backup RBs and pass-catching TEs
- Committee backfields become workhorse opportunities
- Target backup RB props when starter is questionable

**Wide Receivers:**
- WR1 out = WR2/WR3 see 30-40% target increase
- Slot receivers benefit most from outside WR injuries
- TE usage increases when multiple WRs are out

**Offensive Line:**
- Left Tackle injuries hurt QB passing props (more pressure)
- Guard injuries hurt rushing attack
- Center injuries affect entire offensive rhythm

**Defensive Players:**
- CB1 out = Target opposing WR1 OVER props
- MLB out = RB receiving props increase
- Pass rusher out = QB has more time, passing yards OVER
- Safety out = Deep threat WRs become more valuable

### 💡 HOW INJURIES CREATE BETTING VALUE:

**When a Starting QB is Out:**
- Backup RBs see 20-30% more volume (check-downs)
- Game totals drop 7-10 points
- Defensive props become more valuable
- Opposing defense INT props spike

**When Top RB is Out:**
- Backup RB rushing props are undervalued
- More passing attempts (QB passing yards OVER)
- Game pace slows, total points decrease
- WR target share increases

**When WR1 is Injured:**
- WR2 becomes instant WR1 with WR1 coverage
- Slot WR sees massive target increase (8-12 targets)
- TE becomes security blanket (target OVER)
- RB receiving yards increase

**When Defensive Star is Out:**
- Opposing offense gains 50-80 yards on average
- Game total OVER becomes valuable
- Specific position props explode (WR vs backup CB)
- Run game opens up without elite LB/DT

### 📊 SPECIFIC MATCHUP EXPLOITS TODAY:

1. **Jets (0-7) depleted roster** - Bengals offense should feast
   - Target ALL Bengals offensive props OVER
   - Burrow, Chase, Higgins all strong plays

2. **Ravens (1-5) struggling defensively** - Bears should move the ball
   - Bears passing props have value
   - Ravens home splits are terrible this year

3. **Titans (1-6) worst defense in NFL** - Colts will dominate
   - Jonathan Taylor 100+ yards guaranteed
   - Anthony Richardson rushing TD likely

4. **Saints (1-6) in free fall** - Bucs should cruise
   - Tampa receivers all have value
   - Saints can't stop anyone right now
