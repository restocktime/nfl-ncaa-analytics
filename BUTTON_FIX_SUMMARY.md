# Button Functionality Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The user reported that "none of buttons working its there but no one home" - meaning buttons were visible but not functional.

After thorough investigation, I found that most JavaScript functions called by onclick handlers were missing or not properly defined.
