# Live vs Upcoming Games Fix Summary

## üéØ Problem Identified
The dashboard was incorrectly showing "Live Games" when no games were actually live. It should show:
1. **Live Games section** - Only when games are actually live with live scores
2. **Upcoming Games section** - Connected to week tabs and changes as user selects different weeks

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Proper Game Status Detection**
```javascript
// Live games: Only games that are actually in progress
const liveGames = allGames.filter(game => 
    game.status === 'LIVE' || game.status === 'IN_PROGRESS' || game.status === 'HALFTIME'
);

// Upcoming games: Scheduled games for the selected week
const upcomingGames = allGames.filter(game => 
    game.status === 'SCHEDULED' || game.status === 'PRE_GAME' || !game.status
);
```

### 2. **Dynamic Live Games Section**
- **Hidden by default** - Only shows when there are actually live games
- **Live indicator** - Pulsing green badge and icon when visible
- **Real-time scores** - Shows current scores and game status
- **Auto-hide** - Disappears when no games are live

### 3. **Enhanced Upcoming Games Section**
- **Always visible** - Shows upcoming games for selected week
- **Week integration** - Connected to season/week navigation tabs
- **Dynamic updates** - Games change when user selects different weeks
- **Proper labeling** - Shows "Upcoming Games" instead of "Live Games"

### 4. **Week Tab Integration**
- **Real-time updates** - Upcoming games update when changing weeks
- **Season awareness** - Different games for preseason/regular/playoffs
- **Week display** - Shows current selected week in upcoming games header
- **Proper filtering** - Only shows games for the selected week/season
