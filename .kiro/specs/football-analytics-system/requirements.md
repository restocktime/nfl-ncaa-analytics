# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive football analytics system that provides real-time predictions, live probability calculations, and advanced statistical analysis for both NFL and college football. The system will integrate multiple data sources, employ sophisticated modeling techniques including Monte Carlo simulations, and deliver live updates for scores, odds, spreads, player props, injuries, weather conditions, and historical matchups.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a football analyst, I want to access real-time NFL and college football data from multiple sources, so that I can make informed predictions based on current game conditions and historical performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to at least 3 different sports data APIs (SportsDataIO, ESPN, CollegeFootballData.com)
2. WHEN requesting live scores THEN the system SHALL return data within 5 seconds with timestamps
3. WHEN accessing odds and spreads THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates from sources like The Odds API or OpticOdds
4. IF an API rate limit is reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative data sources
5. WHEN retrieving player props THEN the system SHALL include pre-game availability and automatic removal at kickoff
6. WHEN accessing injury reports THEN the system SHALL parse and classify injury status (questionable, probable, out, IR)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a predictive modeler, I want to implement dynamic probability calculations with memory and state tracking, so that I can provide accurate real-time predictions that evolve with game conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game begins THEN the system SHALL initialize Bayesian probability models with pre-game data
2. WHEN in-game events occur THEN the system SHALL update probabilities using Monte Carlo simulations with 1000+ iterations
3. WHEN weather conditions change THEN the system SHALL adjust passing/rushing probabilities based on historical correlations
4. IF a key player injury occurs THEN the system SHALL recalculate team performance probabilities within 30 seconds
5. WHEN tracking game momentum THEN the system SHALL maintain stateful memory using Redis or similar in-memory database
6. WHEN calculating opponent-adjusted metrics THEN the system SHALL apply historical performance data against specific teams and coaches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to integrate advanced modeling techniques and cloud computing resources, so that I can handle complex simulations and provide scalable predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Monte Carlo simulations THEN the system SHALL execute on cloud infrastructure (GCP or AWS) with auto-scaling capabilities
2. WHEN training ML models THEN the system SHALL support XGBoost, neural networks, and ensemble methods
3. WHEN processing historical data THEN the system SHALL implement Poisson distributions for scoring predictions and logistic regression for spreads
4. IF computational load exceeds threshold THEN the system SHALL distribute processing across multiple cloud instances
5. WHEN validating model accuracy THEN the system SHALL use backtesting on at least 3 previous seasons of data
6. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals and model explanations using SHAP values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to receive live updates and access an integrated dashboard, so that I can monitor real-time analytics and make timely decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN games are in progress THEN the system SHALL provide live score updates via WebSocket connections
2. WHEN displaying probabilities THEN the system SHALL update the dashboard every 30 seconds during active games
3. WHEN props become unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically remove them from the interface at kickoff
4. IF system detects unusual betting patterns THEN it SHALL display responsible gambling alerts
5. WHEN accessing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide time-zone aware displays for cross-country games
6. WHEN system experiences errors THEN it SHALL maintain 99.5% uptime with graceful degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to analyze college prospects and draft impacts, so that I can predict how player movements affect team performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing college prospects THEN the system SHALL integrate scouting data with performance metrics
2. WHEN calculating draft impact THEN the system SHALL use Elo ratings and support vector machines for team strength adjustments
3. WHEN tracking player development THEN the system SHALL maintain historical performance against different opponents and coaching systems
4. IF prospect data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL use statistical imputation methods to fill gaps
5. WHEN predicting team changes THEN the system SHALL model roster turnover effects on win probabilities
6. WHEN evaluating coaching impacts THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics under different coaching staff

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and monitoring capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and performance optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic with circuit breakers
2. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL flag anomalies and use data validation rules
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN it SHALL automatically scale resources and alert administrators
4. IF data sources become unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached data and display staleness indicators
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN it SHALL track API response times, prediction accuracy, and user engagement metrics
6. WHEN conducting system maintenance THEN it SHALL support zero-downtime deployments and rollback capabilities
