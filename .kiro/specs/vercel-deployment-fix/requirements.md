# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The fashion-ai-shopper project is failing to deploy on Vercel due to a build command that references a non-existent `client` directory. The deployment process expects a specific project structure that doesn't match the current codebase organization. This feature will resolve the deployment configuration issues and ensure successful builds on Vercel.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Vercel deployment to succeed without directory structure errors, so that the application can be properly hosted and accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vercel build process runs THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to access non-existent directories
2. WHEN the build command executes THEN the system SHALL use the correct project structure paths
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL complete without directory navigation errors
4. IF the project has a client-server architecture THEN the build process SHALL handle both components correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build configuration to match the actual project structure, so that future deployments are reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the build commands SHALL reflect the actual directory layout
2. WHEN updating build scripts THEN the system SHALL validate that all referenced paths exist
3. WHEN configuring Vercel settings THEN the deployment SHALL use appropriate build and output directories
4. IF multiple build steps are required THEN each step SHALL execute in the correct directory context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the deployment process, so that team members can understand and maintain the build configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment configuration is updated THEN documentation SHALL explain the build process
2. WHEN troubleshooting deployment issues THEN logs SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN setup instructions SHALL be accurate and complete
4. IF build configuration changes THEN the documentation SHALL be updated accordingly
