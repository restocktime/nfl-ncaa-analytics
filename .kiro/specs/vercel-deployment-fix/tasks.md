# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current project structure and identify build configuration issues

  - Examine the actual directory structure of the fashion-ai-shopper project
  - Identify where package.json files are located
  - Determine the correct build output directory
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Create project structure validation script

  - Write a Node.js script to validate project directory structure
  - Check for existence of expected directories and files
  - Generate report of current vs expected structure
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Fix package.json build scripts

  - Update build command to match actual project structure
  - Remove references to non-existent `client` directory
  - Ensure build scripts work with current directory layout
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 4. Create or update Vercel configuration file

  - Write vercel.json with correct build and output directory settings
  - Configure build command to match project structure
  - Set appropriate framework detection if needed
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Implement local build testing script

  - Create script to test build process locally before deployment
  - Validate that build output matches Vercel expectations
  - Check for common deployment issues
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 6. Create deployment troubleshooting documentation

  - Document the corrected build process
  - Provide troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues
  - Include setup instructions for new developers
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Test corrected build configuration locally

  - Run build commands locally to verify they work
  - Check that output directory contains expected files
  - Validate that no directory navigation errors occur
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.2_

- [x] 8. Deploy with corrected configuration and validate
  - Deploy to Vercel with updated build configuration
  - Monitor deployment logs for successful completion
  - Verify deployed application loads correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4_
