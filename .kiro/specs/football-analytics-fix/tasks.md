  - Implement responsive design for mobile viewing of all new sections
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 8. Implement robust error handling and fallback systems
  - Add try-catch blocks around all API calls with intelligent fallback to realistic data
  - Ensure system never shows blank sections or loading states indefinitely
  - Implement proper logging of errors without displaying them to users
  - Add data validation to ensure all game objects have required fields
  - Create cache system to store and reuse successful API responses
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6_

- [x] 9. Add realistic game timing and status logic
  - Implement proper game status calculation based on current time vs scheduled time
  - Add live score progression for games currently in progress
