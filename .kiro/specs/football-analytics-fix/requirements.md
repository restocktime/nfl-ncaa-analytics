# Football Analytics System Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements to fix the current football analytics system that is showing incorrect games, missing AI picks, no betting lines, and non-functional ML algorithms. The focus is on creating a working system that displays real, current football data with functional AI predictions and betting information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the football analytics site, I want to see actual NFL and NCAA games happening today or this week, so that I can get relevant, current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the NFL analytics page THEN the system SHALL display real NFL games for the current week
2. WHEN I visit the NCAA analytics page THEN the system SHALL display real college football games for the current week  
3. WHEN no games are scheduled for today THEN the system SHALL show upcoming games for this week
4. WHEN games are live THEN the system SHALL display current scores and game status
5. WHEN games are completed THEN the system SHALL show final scores
6. WHEN it's off-season THEN the system SHALL display a clear message about when the season returns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interested in betting insights, I want to see AI predictions with confidence scores for each game, so that I can understand the system's analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any game THEN the system SHALL display an AI prediction section with win probabilities
2. WHEN showing predictions THEN the system SHALL include confidence percentages (e.g., 78% confidence)
3. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL show predicted final scores
4. WHEN showing spread predictions THEN the system SHALL indicate which team is favored and by how much
5. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide a recommendation (e.g., "Take Chiefs -3.5")
6. WHEN AI is processing THEN the system SHALL show loading states, not empty sections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interested in betting markets, I want to see current betting lines and odds for each game, so that I can compare with AI predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any game THEN the system SHALL display a betting lines section with current odds
2. WHEN showing betting lines THEN the system SHALL include point spreads for both teams
3. WHEN displaying odds THEN the system SHALL show moneyline odds for both teams
4. WHEN showing totals THEN the system SHALL display over/under lines with odds
5. WHEN lines are available THEN the system SHALL indicate which sportsbooks are providing the odds
6. WHEN lines are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show realistic simulated lines based on team strength

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interested in advanced analytics, I want to see ML algorithm predictions and their performance, so that I can understand the system's analytical depth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any game THEN the system SHALL display an ML algorithms section
2. WHEN showing ML predictions THEN the system SHALL include Neural Network, XGBoost, and Ensemble model results
3. WHEN displaying algorithm results THEN the system SHALL show each model's prediction and confidence level
4. WHEN showing model performance THEN the system SHALL display accuracy percentages for each algorithm
5. WHEN models disagree THEN the system SHALL show a consensus prediction with edge indicator (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
6. WHEN algorithms are running THEN the system SHALL show processing indicators, not blank sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on mobile or desktop, I want the interface to be responsive and visually appealing, so that I can easily consume the analytics information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL display all sections in a mobile-friendly layout
2. WHEN viewing predictions THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators (colors, badges, icons)
3. WHEN showing confidence levels THEN the system SHALL use visual elements like progress bars or colored badges
4. WHEN displaying multiple games THEN the system SHALL organize them in an easy-to-scan card layout
5. WHEN games are live THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual indicators (pulsing, colors, "LIVE" badges)
6. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton screens or loading animations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide fallback data, so that users always see functional content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real APIs fail THEN the system SHALL display realistic simulated games based on current date/time
2. WHEN showing simulated data THEN the system SHALL still generate AI predictions and betting lines
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them but continue showing content to users
4. WHEN data is stale THEN the system SHALL indicate the last update time
5. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL show cached data with appropriate indicators
6. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL immediately show content, not blank loading screens
