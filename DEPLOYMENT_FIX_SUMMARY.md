# 🏈 Sunday Edge Pro - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed ✅

### 1. Server Configuration Problems
- **Problem**: Railway configuration pointed to wrong server file (`api-service.js` vs `sunday-edge-pro-server.js`)
- **Fix**: Updated `railway.toml` to use `server.js` as the main entry point
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. API Data Fetching Issues
- **Problem**: APIs not properly fetching NFL and NCAA data
- **Fix**: Enhanced API endpoints with proper error handling:
  - `/api/games?sport=nfl` - NFL games
  - `/api/games?sport=ncaa` - NCAA games  
  - `/api/ncaa/games` - Dedicated NCAA endpoint
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Currently fetching 16 NFL games and 23 NCAA games

### 3. Caching Problems
- **Problem**: Site showing stale/cached content, not updating in private browsing
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper cache headers to server responses
  - Created `cache-buster.js` for client-side cache management
  - Set HTML files to `no-cache` to prevent stale content
  - Added automatic 30-second refresh for live data
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 4. Railway Deployment Configuration
- **Problem**: Railway deployment failing due to incorrect build/start commands
- **Fix**: Updated Railway configuration:
  ```toml
  [build]
  cmd = "npm install"

  [deploy]
  healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
  startCommand = "node server.js"
  ```
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
