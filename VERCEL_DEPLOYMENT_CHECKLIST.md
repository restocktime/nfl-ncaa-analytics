# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Project Structure Validation
- [ ] Verify project structure matches build configuration
- [ ] Ensure package.json exists in the correct location
- [ ] Check that all referenced directories exist

### Build Configuration
- [ ] Review package.json build scripts
- [ ] Verify vercel.json configuration is correct
- [ ] Check output directory setting matches actual build output
- [ ] Ensure install command is appropriate for project structure

### Local Testing
- [ ] Run `npm run build` locally without errors
- [ ] Execute `node test-build-locally.js` successfully
- [ ] Validate project structure with `node validate-project-structure.js`
- [ ] Test that all required files are in output directory

### Environment Setup

- [ ] Set up custom domain (if applicable)
- [ ] Configure DNS settings

### Build Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor build logs during deployment
- [ ] Check for dependency installation errors
- [ ] Verify build commands execute successfully
- [ ] Ensure output directory is created correctly

### Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Test deployed application loads correctly
- [ ] Verify all pages and routes work
- [ ] Check API endpoints respond properly
- [ ] Test critical application functionality
- [ ] Validate environment variables are working

## Troubleshooting Steps

### Build Failures

2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with different browsers and devices

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Vercel dashboard
2. Check bundle size and optimize if needed
3. Verify CDN is working correctly
