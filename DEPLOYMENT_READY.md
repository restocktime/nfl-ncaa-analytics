## 🎯 What This Fixes

**Before (Broken):**
- Site falling back to cached/fake data
- "Fallback mode" showing
- ESPN roster API failing with 404 errors
- Unable to pull tonight's game data

**After (Fixed):**
- Direct ESPN API calls work on Vercel
- Live game data loads correctly
- Roster data fetches successfully
- Tonight's Eagles @ Giants game will show live

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

Once deployed, verify:
1. Go to https://sundayedgepro.com/nfl-live-games.html
2. Should see "Philadelphia Eagles at New York Giants" game
3. Click to view game details
4. Verify live data is loading (not "fallback mode")
5. Check browser console - should see:
   - ✅ "ESPN API Response: 200"
   - ✅ "Live ESPN roster loaded"
   - ❌ No "fallback" messages

## 📊 Technical Changes

**File: `public/espn-live-roster-api.js`**
- Lines 47-68: Changed from proxy endpoint to direct ESPN API
- Added proper headers: `User-Agent`, `Origin`, `Accept`
- Removed dependency on server-side proxy
- Now compatible with Vercel static hosting

## ⚡ Quick Deploy Command

If you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
cd /Users/iby/Desktop/nfl:ncaa && npx vercel --prod
